# Before We Officially Begin

> [!TIP] üí° By the way  
> This article is **not** part of the official UCT tutorial.<br>  
> That‚Äôs why the homepage redirects to **01-Foreword** instead of here.

I felt it was necessary to insert this short article here to briefly talk about the current _predicament_ of both **UCT** and the **UCT Tutorial** itself.

**Undertale Changer Template** is, more or less, a relatively complete project‚Äî  
But completing it was just the first step.

It wasn‚Äôt until I finally forced myself to finish it that I realized: completing it was only the beginning.

And when I tried to actually start writing the tutorial, I realized that things were far more difficult than I had imagined.

**The will is there, but the strength is not.**  
That‚Äôs the most fitting way to put it.

---

On the one hand, I know very well that UCT **deserves a proper introduction**‚Äî

But on the other hand, the reality is:

Promoting **UCT** is **extremely difficult**, and it‚Äôs hard to get any **positive feedback**.  
As a result, the **lack of response**, the **lack of motivation**,  
makes it **incredibly hard** every time I try to sit down and write even a bit of the tutorial.

To be honest, I don‚Äôt have much confidence in myself either.

I‚Äôm afraid that the tutorial I write will be **stiff** and **hard to understand**;  
I‚Äôm afraid the template itself may still have many **immature aspects**;  
I‚Äôm afraid that even if I give it my all, I still won‚Äôt be able to truly convey the **value of UCT**.

**That fear has always been with me.**

---

So maybe this ‚Äúforeword to the foreword‚Äù is really more of a **confession**.

A confession that I‚Äôm trying, but also hesitating and struggling.  
A confession that this path isn‚Äôt easy, and I‚Äôm not strong.

But‚Äî

If you truly want to understand **UCT**,  
If you encounter **issues** while using it, or wish to **ask questions or talk to me**,  
please feel free to join the [UCT Official QQ Group](http://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?_wv=1027&k=wK7VVbI0VU8mPpG94nDLsHaLRbky5cMT&authKey=LQfQsHtXTqbrRdmhSgUtxesNz9UmiETjymrhJF%2BFT1pAiEy0HUxSfM%2Fx%2FsTdOUC%2F&noverify=0&group_code=289694657), or the [UCT Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xvYKa2pSN6), or reach out to me directly.

The door is always open.  
It‚Äôs just that‚ÄîI might need a little time to walk through it.

**Thank you for reading this far.**
