# Installing Unity and the IDE
**UCT** is an Undertale fan game template developed based on **Unity International Version 2021.3.15f1**.

Or, to put it simply: **UCT** is a **Unity project**, so of course, we need to **install Unity** first to use it.

To develop a Unity project, you need to install **Unity Hub** and **Unity Editor**, and choose a suitable **IDE** (code editor) as your development tool.

This chapter will guide you step-by-step through the installation of these tools.

## Tutorial Overview

This section will cover:

- The differences between **Unity China Edition** and **Unity International Edition**
- The distinctions among **Unity Hub, Unity Editor, and Unity Engine**
- How to obtain the **International Version Unity Hub** installer
- Introduction to the installation and configuration of commonly used **IDEs**, with a recommendation to use **Rider**.
- How to import **project-related settings** to standardize the development environment

Ready? Let‚Äôs get started.

## Differences in Unity Versions
> [!WARNING] ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up!  
> The content here is **especially important** for users in **Mainland China** and **Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan regions**.  
> If you are an **overseas** user, you can skip this part and proceed directly to the [**Preparing to Install Unity**](#preparing-to-install-unity) section.

> So, does Unity really have separate China and International editions?

The answer is yes‚ÄîUnity is divided into the **China Edition** and the **International Edition**, which **differ** in services and feature support. Mixing them may lead to **compatibility issues**.

> [!WARNING] ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning!  
> UCT only supports **Unity International Version 2021.3.15f1**. Make sure to use this version.

---  

### How to Check if You‚Äôve Installed the China Edition of Unity?

**For Unity Editor:**
- Check your **Unity Editor** version number: If the version number includes suffixes like **"c1" or "c2"**, you likely have the **China Edition of Unity Editor** installed.

**For Unity Hub:**
- If Unity Hub only allows you to install versions with suffixes like **"c1" or "c2"**, you‚Äôre using the **China Edition of Unity Hub**.

---  

You might think you‚Äôre sharp-eyed or resourceful enough to find the **International Edition website** directly, but‚Äî
> [!CAUTION] ‚õî Plot twist (jk  
> Under **Mainland China‚Äôs network environment**, accessing the Unity website directly may default to the **China Edition** page.  
> Even if you visit the International Edition website, the Unity Hub and Unity Editor you download might still be the China Edition under **Mainland China/Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan network conditions**.

**So, how do you install the International Edition of Unity?**  
Since I‚Äôm not well-versed in network configuration, the advice here is for reference only:

- Ensure you‚Äôre connected to the **global internet** or using a **VPN** throughout the process. In the next section of the tutorial, make sure to visit the [Unity International Edition website (unity.com)](https://unity.com/) (not unity.cn) and download resources without **"c1", "c2"**, or similar suffixes.

If you‚Äôre unable to download International Edition resources, consider joining the [**Official UCT QQ Group**](http://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?_wv=1027&k=wK7VVbI0VU8mPpG94nDLsHaLRbky5cMT&authKey=LQfQsHtXTqbrRdmhSgUtxesNz9UmiETjymrhJF%2BFT1pAiEy0HUxSfM%2Fx%2FsTdOUC%2F&noverify=0&group_code=289694657) and obtaining the International Edition Unity Hub installer from the **group files** to ensure version consistency.

## Preparing to Install Unity
In this section, we‚Äôll install Unity!  
Open your browser and go to [unity.com](https://unity.com/)! (**Make sure it‚Äôs not unity.cn!**)

You‚Äôll see a homepage like this:

<img src="/02/UnityWeb0.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Just click Download‚Äîthen, you‚Äôll land on this page:

<img src="/02/UnityWeb1.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Wow, the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most popular development platform‚Äù (big doubt) is within reach‚Äîjust click the download button, and then!

<img src="/02/UnityWeb2.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

We‚Äôve got‚ÄîUnity‚ÄîHub?

You might wonder‚ÄîI know Unity, but‚Äî
- What is Unity **Hub**?
- How is the Unity **Editor** different from Unity itself?
- You might have also heard Unity referred to as the Unity **Engine**‚Äîwait, isn‚Äôt Unity a **‚Äúgame engine‚Äù**?

Let‚Äôs briefly explain these concepts.

---  

### What Exactly is ‚ÄúUnity‚Äù?
Unity actually consists of three parts: **Unity Hub**, **Unity Editor**, and **Unity Engine**.

- **Unity Hub** is a **launcher** used to manage Unity Editor versions and projects. You can use it to install or uninstall different versions of the **Unity Editor** and manage your projects. **To develop with Unity, the first thing you need to install is Unity Hub.**
- **Unity Editor** is the **editor software** used for game development, providing a visual interface, scene editing, and other features.
- **Unity Engine** is the core part responsible for runtime game functionality, handling rendering, physics, animation, audio, and other systems. **It‚Äôs not a standalone software but is embedded in the Unity Editor and operates in the built game.**

> [!NOTE]üñä In short:
>- Unity Hub is the tool for downloading and managing different versions of the Unity Editor and launching the development environment.
>- Unity Editor is where you edit game scenes.
>- Unity Engine is the core behind the game‚Äôs runtime, handling rendering, physics, etc.

During development, we use Unity Hub to download and manage local versions of the Unity Editor and all local projects.  
When you launch a project in Unity Hub, you‚Äôre actually opening the project with the Unity Editor.

After the game is built (exported), the Unity Editor isn‚Äôt included‚Äîonly the runtime part of the Unity Engine is packaged to ensure the game runs properly.

::: details ‚ùî Still confused? Let me give an analogy...  
Take Minecraft as an example:
- Unity Hub is like Minecraft‚Äôs launcher, responsible for downloading and launching different game versions.
- Unity Editor is like a ‚Äúmap editor‚Äù software for Minecraft, helping you design and edit the game world.
- Unity Engine is like Minecraft‚Äôs core runtime, making the game run, render, and interact.

Only by combining these three can your game truly run.

> [!TIP] üí° So‚Äî  
> We‚Äôll first install Unity Hub, then use it to install Unity Editor. That‚Äôs how Unity gets installed!

---  

### Installing Unity Hub

By now, you should have downloaded the **Unity Hub** installer‚Äîdouble-click it and install it!

*Remember, you need to install the International Edition of Unity Hub!*

<img src="/02/UnityWeb3.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

The only thing to note during installation is to **install it in a directory with only English characters**. Other than that, it‚Äôs straightforward.  
If you can‚Äôt figure this out, maybe it‚Äôs time to call it a day.

After installation, open **Unity Hub**, and you‚Äôll see this interface.

<img src="/02/UnityHub0.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Yes. We need a **Unity account** to use Unity.

If you already have an account, click **Sign in**;  
If not, **Create account**.

For account registration and login, handle it yourself‚Äîthis tutorial won‚Äôt go into detail.  
Unity International and China Edition accounts might be interchangeable‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not sure, so proceed at your own discretion.  
~~Account versions shouldn‚Äôt cause major issues, right folks?~~

---  

After that, we‚Äôll see the Unity Hub homepage‚Äîlike this.

<img src="/02/UnityHub1.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

In Unity Hub, we mainly use three pages‚Äî

> [!TIP] üí° The Three Musketeers
> - Projects: Here, you open any **Unity project**.
> - Installs: Here, you install **Unity Editor**.
> - Preferences: Here, you **request a license**, modify **installation paths** and **cache directories**,  
    > and change Unity Hub‚Äôs **language**.

Wait, you might ask, where‚Äôs the Preferences option‚Äî

<img src="/02/UnityHub2.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Here, the gear icon.

Let‚Äôs open it! Tweaking Preferences is essential‚Äî**requesting a license**, modifying **installation paths** and **cache directories** are all important.  
Without a license, you can‚Äôt open projects; without changing installation paths, your Editor and projects will hog your system drive‚Äîright?

<img src="/02/UnityHub3.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Here, change the language Unity Hub uses.

<img src="/02/UnityHub4.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Here, set up your license. The free Personal license is more than enough.

<img src="/02/UnityHub5.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Here, set the location for new Unity projects. It‚Äôs best to change it to a non-system drive.

<img src="/02/UnityHub6.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Here, set the Unity Editor installation path and some download file locations‚Äîalso best to move them off the system drive.

Unity Hub setup is complete. Next‚Äîlet‚Äôs install the Editor!

---  
### Installing Unity Editor

Click on **Installs**, which shows all locally installed Unity Editor versions‚Äî  
Like this. I‚Äôve already installed **Unity Editor 2021.3.15f1**!

<img src="/02/UnityHub7.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Oh, yours is probably empty. No worries‚Äîtry clicking the **‚ÄúInstall Editor‚Äù** button.  
Then the question arises‚Äî

<img src="/02/UnityHub8.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

There are many versions here, but for 2021, there‚Äôs only this‚Äî2021.3.45f1...?

Note that this version is **not 2021.3.15f1**. Though the difference seems minor, it might cause issues‚Äîat least some group members have reported problems.  
Changing to major versions like 2022, 2023, or even Unity 6? Absolutely not! Who knows what issues you‚Äôll face‚Äîand I won‚Äôt adapt for them. *I don‚Äôt see the need.*

> [!IMPORTANT] üìç Remember this  
> You must use **Unity Editor 2021.3.15f1**. Both the major and minor version numbers must match exactly.

So how do we download this version? It‚Äôs simple‚Äîjust visit this link in your browser:
```  
unityhub://2021.3.15f1/e8e88683f834  
```  

<img src="/02/UnityHub9.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Then you‚Äôll see a prompt like this, asking to open Unity Hub from the browser.

<img src="/02/UnityHub10.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

After opening Unity Hub, this window will appear‚Äîwe‚Äôre almost done.  
*The top-left corner should say **Install Unity 2021.3.15f1**,  
~~but since I‚Äôve already installed it, I‚Äôll demonstrate with 2021.3.45f1 for the screenshot~~*

There are some optional add-ons here. I‚Äôll explain them one by one.

---  

#### Editor Add-ons - Development Tools (IDE)

<img src="/02/UnityHub11.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Under Development Tools, you‚Äôll see **Visual Studio 2019**.  
If you check this and install Unity Editor, Unity Hub will bundle-install **VS2019**.  
**VS2019** is one of the many **IDE** options‚Äîthe thing you use to write code‚Äîmentioned later.

I emphasize: it‚Äôs **one** of the options. And it‚Äôs not my recommended **IDE**. I‚Äôll explain why later.  
So, if you want another IDE, don‚Äôt check this. You only need one IDE.

#### Editor Add-ons - Platforms

<img src="/02/UnityHub12.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

If you want to export your Unity project to Android, Mac, Linux..., you‚Äôll need the corresponding platform add-ons.  
Install them as needed‚Äîbut note that UCT hasn‚Äôt been adapted for multiple platforms yet.  
If you want to export your project to multiple platforms, it‚Äôs theoretically possible, but you‚Äôll need to make your own adjustments.  
I can‚Äôt help with that, *~~but if anyone figures it out, feel free to share~~*

> [!TIP] üí° Oh, and  
> You don‚Äôt have to install any platform add-ons. Exporting to exe is the default and requires no add-ons.  
> If you want to install platform add-ons later, it‚Äôs easy‚Äîjust select ‚ÄúAdd Modules‚Äù in Unity Hub.  
> <img src="/02/UnityHub15.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  
> Like this.

#### Editor Add-ons - Language Packs

<img src="/02/UnityHub13.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Installing language packs lets you change Unity Editor‚Äôs display language.  
For non-native English speakers, this is useful, right?  
Install as needed.

#### Editor Add-ons - Documentation

<img src="/02/UnityHub14.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Checking this installs local Unity documentation.  
...But I think online docs are enough‚Äîthis thing takes up 700MB, which seems excessive.  
Still, install it if you want.

*Oh, you‚Äôre asking where the online docs are? Didn‚Äôt Chapter 1 mention it? (Unity Scripting API, Unity Manual)*

---  
After selecting your add-ons, you can proceed with the installation.  
That‚Äôs it for Unity Editor‚Äî*at least the installation part.*

Downloading and installing Unity Editor takes a while...  
Why not think about which **IDE** to use for coding in the meantime?

---  

### Choosing the Right IDE

Unity supports the following mainstream code editors. Choose based on your needs:

| Editor             | Key Features                                   |  
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| Visual Studio    | Powerful, excellent debugging, one of the official recommendations. <br>But slow to start and resource-heavy. |  
| Visual Studio Code | Lightweight, flexible, cross-platform, rich plugin ecosystem. |  
| **Rider (Recommended)** | Fast startup, strong code completion and refactoring, good Unity support, **free for non-commercial use**. |  

All three work fine with Unity, but I‚Äôve always used **Rider** and **highly recommend it**.  
This tutorial is **written and explained based on Rider**. Later, I‚Äôll also show you how to use the Rider project settings I‚Äôve prepared.  
If you plan to contribute to UCT development or submit code, it‚Äôs best to use Rider‚Äî

**A unified development environment saves a lot of communication overhead.**

---  

### How to Install Rider

There are two ways to install **Rider**.  
Method 1: Direct download‚Äîvisit the [**JetBrains Rider website**](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and download the installer.  
Method 2: Use [**JetBrains Toolbox**](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)‚Äîa tool for managing JetBrains IDEs and projects, similar to Unity Hub but for JetBrains' development tools.

If you're still unsure what Toolbox does, this image should give you an idea:

<img src="/02/ToolBox0.png" alt="Head" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>  

Choose either method to install **Rider** based on your preference.

#### Recommended Rider Plugins

It‚Äôs highly recommended to install all the following plugins‚Äîthey‚Äôre incredibly useful.  
Beyond these, feel free to customize Rider to your liking.

| Plugin Name                  | Description                              |  
| ----------------------- |----------------------------------|  
| .ignore                 | Manages `.gitignore` files, improving version control efficiency. |  
| CodeGlance Pro          | Displays a code mini-map on the editor‚Äôs right side for quick navigation. |  
| Heap Allocations Viewer | Tracks heap allocations in C# code, aiding performance optimization. |  
| Key Promoter X          | Suggests keyboard shortcuts when using menu actions, helping you learn shortcuts faster. |  
| SonarQube for IDE       | Integrates SonarQube for static code analysis and quality reports. |  

#### Importing Project Settings

The UCT project follows Rider‚Äôs recommended coding style and SonarQube‚Äôs suggestions but may differ in minor details.  
For example, I prefer always using braces for `if`, `for`, and other control structures.  
To apply UCT‚Äôs settings, go to **File ‚Üí Manage IDE Settings ‚Üí Import Settings** in Rider and load the `settings.zip` file from UCT‚Äôs root directory.  
This will be covered in detail in the next tutorial.

---  

## Conclusion

At this point, **Unity and the IDE installation are complete**! We‚Äôre halfway prepared. ~~(Probably.)~~

In the next chapter, we‚Äôll cover downloading the **UCT project**, linking Unity Editor with Rider (or another IDE),  
and setting up **Git** for version control. This will help track changes, revert mistakes, and even enable collaborative development.

See you soon!
