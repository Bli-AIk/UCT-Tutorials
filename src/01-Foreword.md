# Foreword

Welcome! This is the first chapter of the official tutorial documentation for UCT.

![FullLogo](/01/FullLogo.png)

## Tutorial Outline

This tutorial is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the core concepts of **Undertale Changer Template** (UCT), its advantages, and how to get started quickly.

**UCT** is a template for **Undertale fan games**, built on the **Unity engine** and utilizing the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, designed for both **full-process game development** and **stylized development**. It is specifically crafted to meet the advanced needs of projects requiring **full-cycle game development**, **3D effects**, **Live2D**, and other advanced features.

Its main features include:

- **Based on the Unity engine**
- **Supports 2D lighting and 3D models**
- **Fully open-source** (licensed under the **GNU GPLv3**, see notes for details)
- **Supports community extensions**
- **Comprehensive localization support**

> [!WARNING]  
> For users who only need to develop **single battles or simple scenes**, UCT may not be the best choice. In such cases, projects based on [**Undertale Engine**](https://github.com/TML233/UndertaleEngine) or [**Create Your Frisk**](https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk) might be more suitable.

However, if you wish to break free from traditional frameworks and experience **full-process development** or **stylized development**, UCT will undoubtedly offer a more compelling solution.

## Prerequisites

Before using UCT, it’s recommended that you have the following basic knowledge:

- **Basic knowledge of C#**
- **Basic knowledge of Unity**
- **Game design patterns** (optional)
- **Basic knowledge of Git** (optional)

In this tutorial, basic C# concepts and fundamental Unity usage will be briefly covered, but I recommend that you first study C# and Unity to better understand the material.

The game design patterns used in UCT will be briefly explained in later sections.

Git operations will be covered in more detail in subsequent chapters.

## Recommended Basic Tutorials

## Tutorial Goals and Content

The main goal of this tutorial is to help you understand the **creative vision** and **usage** of **UCT**, laying a solid foundation for your future development work.

The content includes:

This tutorial series is focused on the UCT template, and you can choose to study all or part of the material based on your needs.

## Learning Suggestions

- **If you prefer small-scale projects**: Use [**Undertale Engine**](https://github.com/TML233/UndertaleEngine) or [**Create Your Frisk**](https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk), instead of UCT.
- **If you are a beginner**: It’s recommended to first learn the foundational knowledge, then dive into the tutorial.
- **If you have some programming experience**: You may find the content in this tutorial easier to understand.

> [!NOTE]  
> Please take a moment to reflect: **Are you ready to break the mold and take on the challenge?**

If the answer is yes, then continue exploring and discover how to use UCT to create innovative and artistic works.
