## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial is designed to thoroughly introduce the basic concepts, advantages, and quick-start guidance for the **Undertale Changer Template** (hereafter referred to as UCT).

**UCT** is a fan game development template for **Undertale**, built on the **Unity engine**, using the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**.  
It is tailored for **full-scale development** or **stylized game development**, and designed to meet advanced requirements such as **full gameplay workflow**, **3D visuals**, and **Live2D** integration.

Key features include:

- **Built on the Unity engine**
- **Support for 2D lighting and 3D models**
- **Fully open source** (under the **GNU GPLv3** license, see [**License, Monetization, and Copyright Notice**](https://github.com/Bli-AIk/Undertale-Changer-Template/blob/main/LICENSE_MONETIZATION_AND_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE_zh-CN.md))
- **Community extensibility support**
- **Complete localization support**

> [!WARNING] ⚠️ A word of caution...
> If you only need to develop **a single battle or a simple scene**, UCT may not be the best fit.  
> In that case, it might be more appropriate to develop using projects like [**Undertale Engine**](https://github.com/TML233/UndertaleEngine) or [**Create Your Frisk**](https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk).

But if you're aiming to break out of conventional frameworks and want to experience **full-scale** or **highly stylized development**, UCT will no doubt offer a more compelling solution.

## Prerequisites

Before using UCT, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of the following:

- **C# fundamentals**
- **Unity engine basics**
- **Game design patterns** (optional)
- **Git basics** (optional)

This tutorial will briefly explain some C# and Unity concepts when necessary (such as interfaces, coroutines, etc.), or provide external reference links.  
However, I strongly recommend gaining a solid foundation in C# and Unity before starting this tutorial, so you can follow along more smoothly.

As for the game design patterns used in UCT, these will be explained in later chapters as needed, with optional references provided.  
Git basics will be explained in detail in a dedicated later section.

## Recommended Beginner Resources

If you are not yet familiar with **C#** or the **Unity engine**, you can refer to the following beginner-friendly materials:

## Tutorial Goals & Structure

The main goal of this tutorial is to guide you through understanding the **design philosophy** and **usage patterns** of UCT, helping you build a solid foundation for future development.

This includes:

- **Analysis of the Original Game**: Breakdown of Undertale’s core elements to demonstrate UCT's approach to full-project development.
- **Scene Module Explanations**: Detailed explanations of modules like Overworld, Battle, settings pages, etc.
- **Basic Development & Expansion**: Tutorials on how to use the existing content—covering puzzle rooms, dialogue systems, monster battles, and boss fights.

This series is structured around the UCT template itself. You may choose to follow the entire course or focus only on parts relevant to your project.

## Learning Advice

- **If you're aiming for small-scale projects**: Consider using [**Undertale Engine**](https://github.com/TML233/UndertaleEngine) or [**Create Your Frisk**](https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk) instead of UCT.
- **If you're a complete beginner**: Learn the basics of C#, Unity, and Git first before diving in.
- **If you have some programming experience**: You'll likely find this tutorial easier to follow.

> [!NOTE] 🖊 Something to think about  
> Ask yourself: **Are you ready to break the mold and embrace the challenge?**

If the answer is yes, then keep going—and let’s explore how UCT can help you build something truly original and artistic.

Looking forward to learning and growing with you in the chapters to come.
